6. The UPDATE State


      QUIT

         Arguments: none

         Restrictions: none

         Discussion:
             The POP3 server removes all messages marked as deleted
             from the maildrop and replies as to the status of this
             operation.  If there is an error, such as a resource
             shortage, encountered while removing messages, the
             maildrop may result in having some or none of the messages
             marked as deleted be removed.  In no case may the server
             remove any messages not marked as deleted.

             Whether the removal was successful or not, the server
             then releases any exclusive-access lock on the maildrop
             and closes the TCP connection.

         Possible Responses:
             +OK
             -ERR some deleted messages not removed

         Examples:
             C: QUIT
             S: +OK dewey POP3 server signing off (maildrop empty)
